## Design Principles

### Avoid AI-Style Clichés

Actively avoid these telltale "obviously AI" design patterns:

- Overuse of gradient backgrounds (especially purple-pink-blue gradients)
- Rounded cards with a colored left-border accent
- Drawing complex graphics with SVG (use placeholders and request real assets instead)
- Cookie-cutter gradient buttons + large-radius card combos
- Overreliance on overused fonts: **Inter, Roboto, Arial, Fraunces, system-ui**
- Meaningless stats / numbers / icon spam ("data slop")
- Fabricated customer logo walls or fake testimonial counts

### Emoji Rules

**No emoji by default.** Only use emoji when the target design system/brand itself uses them (e.g., Notion, early Linear, certain consumer brands), and match their density and context precisely.

- ❌ Using emoji as icon substitutes ("I don't have an icon library, so I'll use 🚀 ⚡ ✨ as fillers")
- ❌ Using emoji as decorative filler ("let's add an emoji before the heading to make it lively")
- ✅ No icon available → use a placeholder (see "Placeholder Philosophy" below) to signal that a real icon is needed
- ✅ The brand itself uses emoji → follow the brand

### Placeholder Philosophy

**When you lack icons, images, or components, a placeholder is more professional than a poorly drawn fake.**

- Missing icon → square + label (e.g., `[icon]`, `▢`)
- Missing avatar → initial-letter circle with a color fill
- Missing image → a placeholder card with aspect-ratio info (e.g., `16:9 image`)
- Missing data → proactively ask the user for it; never fabricate
- Missing logo → brand name in text + a simple geometric shape

A placeholder signals "real material needed here." A fake signals "I cut corners."

### Aim to Stun

- Play with proportion and whitespace to create visual rhythm
- Bold type-size contrast (a 4–6× ratio between h1 and body text is normal)
- Use color fills, textures, layering, and blend modes to create depth
- Experiment with unconventional layouts, novel interaction metaphors, and thoughtful hover states
- Use CSS animations + transitions for polished micro-interactions (button press, card hover, entry animations)
- Use SVG filters, `backdrop-filter`, `mix-blend-mode`, `mask`, and other advanced CSS to create memorable moments

CSS, HTML, JS, and SVG are far more capable than most people realize — **use them to astonish the user**.

### Appropriate Scale

| Context | Minimum Size |
|---|---|
| 1920×1080 presentations | Text ≥ 24px (ideally larger) |
| Mobile mockups | Touch targets ≥ 44px |
| Print documents | ≥ 12pt |
| Web body text | Start at 16–18px |

### Content Principles

- **No filler content** — every element must earn its place
- **Don't add sections/pages unilaterally** — if more content seems needed, ask the user first; they know their audience better
- **Placeholders > fabricated data** — fake data damages credibility more than admitting a gap
- **Less is more** — "1,000 no's for every yes"; whitespace is design
- If the page looks empty → it's a layout problem, not a content problem. Solve it with composition, whitespace, and type-scale rhythm, not by stuffing content in
